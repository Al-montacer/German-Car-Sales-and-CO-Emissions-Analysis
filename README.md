# German Car Sales and CO₂ Emissions Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the trends in car sales in Germany, comparing electric and fossil-fuel-powered vehicles, and their relationship with traffic CO₂ emissions over the years. The analysis aims to provide insights into the automotive industry's evolution towards sustainable practices and the impact of electric vehicle adoption on environmental pollution.

## Data Source

The data was sourced from two official reports:
- Car sales data from the [Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA)](https://www.kba.de/DE/Statistik/Produktkatalog/produkte/Fahrzeuge/fz14_n_uebersicht.html?nn=3514348)
- Traffic CO₂ emission data from the [Umweltbundesamt](https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/verkehr/emissionen-des-verkehrs#verkehr-belastet-luft-und-klima-minderungsziele-der-bundesregierung)

## Methodology

The analysis involved data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The process included:
- Reading and cleaning data from Excel files
- Translating German column headers to English
- Merging datasets on the 'Year' column
- Plotting time series data for car sales and CO₂ emissions

## Results

The resulting visualizations demonstrate the trends and shifts in car sales by fuel type and the corresponding traffic CO₂ emissions over the years.

## Libraries

- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
